# PlaylistExtractor
This application reads in a play lists (atm m3u, m3u8 and wpl) and copy's all files(songs) from the play list to an preferred location like a mp3-player or a backup place.

Most playlists now use the UTF8 encoding. If the loading fails you can change the encoding under the options menu.
